Filter products by category (e.g., men's clothing, women's clothing, jewelry, electronics).
Sort products by price in ascending (low to high) or descending (high to low) order.
Display product information, including title, description, price, and user ratings.
Responsive design for a user-friendly experience on various devices.
Technologies Used:

React: Building the user interface and handling data.
Material-UI: Styling components and user interface elements.
Next.js: For creating a server-rendered React application.
JavaScript (ES6): The primary programming language used.
JSON Data: Storing the product information.
